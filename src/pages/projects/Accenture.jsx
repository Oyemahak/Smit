                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>
                    Managing job profiles across various departments can be complicated and disconnected. The Job Profile Accelerator project
                    aimed to simplify this process, making it easier for consultants and reviewers to handle job profiles efficiently.
                    Additionally, the Source Profile Summary page required specific enhancements to better meet user needs and improve overall usability.
                </p>

                <h3>Design Process</h3>
                <ul className="cs-list">
                    <li><strong>Homepage:</strong> I designed a clean and functional homepage that allowed users to navigate effortlessly, improving their overall experience from the first interaction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Source Profile Summary Page Adjustments:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Graph Redesign:</strong> Changed the vertical bar graph to a horizontal one as per client specifications, making the data easier to read and understand.</li>
                            <li><strong>Iconography:</strong> Enhanced the icons on the left panel to better match the page titles, ensuring the interface was both cohesive and intuitive.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    The final design introduced a sleek and intuitive dashboard that streamlined the job profile management process.
                    By simplifying the workflow and making the interface more user-friendly, the updated homepage and Source Profile
                    Summary page significantly improved efficiency for consultants and reviewers.

                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>
                    The original AMIS dashboard suffered from poor visual design, including unengaging headers and misaligned elements,
                    which resulted in a suboptimal user experience. The project goal was to refresh the interface while maintaining
                    alignment with brand guidelines.
                </p>

                <h3>Design Process</h3>
                <ul className="cs-list">
                    <li><strong>Heuristic Evaluation:</strong> Identified key usability issues through a thorough heuristic evaluation.</li>
                    <li><strong>UI Refinement:</strong> Focused on making targeted adjustments to improve visual hierarchy and align the interface with brand standards.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Feedback:</strong> Gathered insights from stakeholders to ensure the redesign met both user and business needs.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    The updated AMIS dashboard featured subtle but impactful changes. The color scheme was adjusted for better contrast
                    and alignment issues were resolved, making the dashboard more visually appealing and easier to navigate.

                    The existing solution for tracking file uploads and activities was inefficient and time-consuming, particularly for
                    developers. The goal was to create a streamlined application that allowed for easy entries and made it simpler for
                    team leads to track activities and leaves.

                    Through these projects, I've gained invaluable experience in applying user-centered design principles to solve complex
                    problems. Whether it's a complete redesign or targeted improvements, my focus has always been on enhancing usability
                    and efficiency. By involving users throughout the design process and iterating based on their feedback, I've been able
                    to deliver solutions that not only meet but exceed expectations.
