        <h1>Citi Bank – Data Management Simplified</h1>
        <p className="project-type">UI/UX Case Study · 2024</p>
        <p className="project-description">As part of a larger project at Accenture, I collaborated on designing multiple user interfaces for Citi Bank employees. The project aimed to develop a unified platform for managing complex data systems, streamlining workflows, and reducing operational errors.</p>

        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>
          I joined this project as a Junior UX Designer midway through development. My role involved supporting senior designers with UI tasks, conducting heuristic evaluations, and creating user flows from existing wireframes. I maintained the established brand guidelines and identity throughout. Due to the project’s confidentiality and complexity, I’ll focus on key design aspects and provide an overview of selected screens.
